      <h3>machine-learning-repos</h3>
      <p>Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that empowers systems to learn from data without explicit programming. ML algorithms analyze vast datasets to identify patterns, extract insights, and make predictions or decisions based on the derived knowledge. Unlike traditional programming, which relies on predefined rules, ML leverages statistical techniques and algorithms to enable systems to adapt and improve their performance over time. This adaptability allows ML to tackle complex problems in various domains, including image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.</p>

      <h3>Banking System </h3>
      <p>ðŸš€ Introducing the Basic Banking System Project!ðŸš€

        I'm thrilled to share a project I've been working on: a Basic Banking System. This simple dynamic website allows for seamless money transfers between users without the need for login or user creation. Hereâ€™s a quick overview of the project:
        
        Key Features: 1.Database Setup:
        
        Created dummy data for up to 10 customers using MySQL, MongoDB, or Postgres.
        Customers table includes basic fields: name, email, current balance, etc.
        Transfers table records all transactions.
        Website Flow:
        Home Page: Overview and navigation.
        View All Customers: Display a list of all customers.
        View One Customer: Select and view details of a specific customer.
        Transfer Money: Transfer money between customers.
        Select Customer to Transfer To: Choose the recipient from the customer list.
        View All Customers: Review updated customer balances after the transfer.
        This project is a great way to get hands-on experience with database management, backend development, and deployment on various platforms. Whether you're a beginner or looking to brush up on your skills, this project has something for everyone.
